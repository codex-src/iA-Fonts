# iA Fonts

**I did not make these fonts!** These were designed and developed by [Oliver Reichenstein @iaolo](https://github.com/iaolo), and I forked them from the [official open source repo](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) to make it easier to expose them as webfonts. Variable fonts are not yet linked.

For a detailed exploration into the design and development of these fonts, please see this [introductory article](https://ia.net/writer/blog/a-typographic-christmas) from the official iA Writer blog.

> iA Writer started off with one font. The classic Nitti, designed by Bold Monday. Last year we added iA Writer Duo, a two-spaced typeface that gives a bit more room to W’s and M’s, based on IBM Plex. This year, we add a third font with four character sizes, called iA Writer Quattro and unify the designs.
>
> Quattro shares similarities with a proportional typeface. At the same time, it retains a lot of the technical virtues of the classic typewriter fonts using wider gaps between the words and giving each letter more room than a classic, fully proportional face.

If you want to be use these fonts in your own project, you should be able to import them (once downloaded) like so:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="iA Writer Mono/Webfonts/index.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="iA Writer Duo/Webfonts/index.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="iA Writer Quattro/Webfonts/index.css">
```
