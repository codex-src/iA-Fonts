# iA Fonts

_**I did not make these fonts!** These were designed and developed by [Oliver Reichenstein @iaolo](https://github.com/iaolo), and I forked them from the [official repo](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) (open source) to make it easier to expose them as webfonts. Variable fonts are not yet linked._

For a detailed exploration into the design and development of these fonts, please see this [introductory article](https://ia.net/writer/blog/a-typographic-christmas) from the official iA Writer blog.

If you want to be use these fonts in your own project, you should be able to import them (once downloaded) like so:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="iA Writer Mono/Webfonts/index.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="iA Writer Duo/Webfonts/index.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="iA Writer Quattro/Webfonts/index.css">
```

Please refer to [index.html](https://github.com/codex-src/iA-Fonts/blob/master/index.html) for example usage.
